The source code for my Ludum Dare 58 Compo submission

# Source Code Explained
I am using the Godot game engine in version 4.5 for my project.

I separate my files in:
- addons
- assets
- scenes
- scripts

Scripts are usually connected to scenes so others might keep them in the same folder.

I just like separating them because it gives a better overview when I search for files in the editor.

Also: It is easier to keep track of all the scripts in Visual Studio Code when they are all in one place :D
